Personal Responsive Portfolio Website

# Responsive Portfolio Guidelines

This is an example of a personal portfolio website using my personal information to exhibit the template. This particular template utilized React and Semantic UI React and @artsy/fresnel to build the layout and provide responsiveness for the client that can be easily customized. The template includes: a landing image, an area to display a personal image and professional summary, a portfolio section with separate cards for each project that include an area for an image, the title of the project, and links to the repository and published site, and a contact area that allows visitors to send an e-mail or review the person's GitHub or LinkedIn profiles. Below is an overview of the template components provided to the end-user as their source code.

The application will be invoked with the following command:


### npm start


All information provided in the site relates to my professional work and is provided only to illustrate the components of the site.
